# Neovim Config

The current Neovim configuration I am using for most of my work.

## Description 

This repository contains all configuration files to have a minimalistic Neovim instance up and running.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

* Neovim
* (zsh)

### Installation

* Clone this repository to ~/.config/nvim/ (for macOS, if you use any other OS this may be different)
* Check / Verify / Adapt any of the config files contained in the repository
* Open Neovim and wait for all packages to install
* Increase your productivity and have fun :)

### What's next

* This configures Neovim in a way that I like it, so change any of the options!
* Check out the repositories of the installed plugins and see how you can configure them

## Notes 

I am working on a Intel-based MacBook. I won't and can't
guarantee that anything works (correctly) and/or that nothing will break.
